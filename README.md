## LearnMe

**LearnMe** is a free and easy-to-use extension for the Google Chrome and 
Mozilla Firefox browsers that can help you to increase vocabulary of foreing 
language you learn.

There is a good and funny way to improve your listening skills. It's about 
watching movies in language you study. You can watch them with subtitles. 
But, in this case, you'll just improve your reading skills instead of listening. 
It's because your brain will probably choose more easier way to do its job.

That's why you should watch foreign films without any subtitles. But what about 
if you want to know every word from film you're going to watch? It's a pretty 
good choice. But you should to prepare yourself before you start.

At first, you need to download subtitles for that movie. There is no problem 
at this step usually. The next step is you have to select from that text every 
word that you don't know to learn it. And this extension can help you with that.

Just open a file of text or subtitles (only SRT format is supported) in browser, 
the extension's icon becomes active. You may see in the browser's address bar 
something like this:

```
file:///D:/movies/my_film.srt
```

After that, click extension's icon at first time to prepare the text for 
selecting of words. Pick up words you need to learn by clicking on them. And 
click the icon at second time to get a list of words you've selected. That's 
all.

You can also use my next free application **LearnWords** that was specially 
designed for quick memorizing foreign words. You're welcome to provide me an 
advice how would you like the apps to be improved.
